### Basic Pre-Requisites

> [!TIP]
> This platform is built on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and utilizes [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to ensure the quickest response times achievable. While `npm` can also be used, the commands for npm would mirror those of Bun, simply substituting the specific commands accordingly.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

- Windows

```powershell
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Verify installations

- Check that both Node.js and Bun are correctly installed by running.

```bash
node -v
bun -v
```

### Install Dependencies

- You can use Bun to install dependencies quickly. If you prefer, `npm` can also be used with equivalent commands.

```bash
bun install
```


### 3. Run on development &/or production (npm also works)

- Run on development mode

```bash
bun run dev
```

- Run on production mode

```bash
bun start
```
